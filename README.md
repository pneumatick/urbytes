# Urbytes

Urbytes is an attempt at creating a decentralized, peer-to-peer microblogging network using Urbit. It is designed in such a way that users own and directly control their posts and engagement information, allowing them to take it all with them wherever they bring their ship. Unlike SNS's such as Twitter, users aren't beholden to arbitrary censorship or manipulation on the native app, because all information is owned by the user, as stated above, and it is sent and received in a peer-to-peer fashion. It was also designed with the intention of allowing users to provide their information voluntarily to third-party services that can extend the functionality of the app, such as sentiment analysis on incoming posts, sophisticated recommendation algorithms, paid promotions for posts, and/or enhanced user discovery methods, just to give a few examples.


# Nomenclature Guide

Urbytes uses a gastronomic nomenclature in order to both distinguish itself from similar apps/services, as well as to convey a sense of community and intentionality. Using Urbytes is meant to feel like a dinner with friends and family, where everyone brings something significant to the table. You wouldn't mindlessly consume your food in such a setting, but you would chew on it, ponder it, make thoughtful comments on it, and, if it's really good, share it with others at your table.

Below are the unfamiliar words used to describe the actions and information on Urbytes, using Twitter equivalents for brevity.

- **To serve = To tweet**
- **A bite = A tweet**
- **To share = To retweet**
- **To comment = To reply**
- **A comment = A reply**

There is also the main feed, likes, a following list, and a followers list, but all of these terms should be familiar and self-explanatory to most users.
